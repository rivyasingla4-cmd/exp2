# Aim

To study and understand Python List data structure and perform various operations 

⸻

# Tools Required
	•	Python Interpreter (Python 3.x)
	•	Any IDE or Editor (IDLE, VS Code, PyCharm, Jupyter Notebook)
	•	Basic knowledge of Python syntax

⸻

# Algorithm
	1.	Create lists with different elements.
	2.	Display list elements using print().
	3.	Access list elements using positive and negative indexing.
	4.	Add elements using append() and insert().
	5.	Modify elements using index assignment.
	6.	Combine lists using extend().
	7.	Extract elements using slicing.
	8.	Remove elements using remove().
	9.	Convert string values into integers using list comprehension.
	10.	Apply built-in functions (max, min, sum, len, sorted) on the list.
	11.	Display the final results.

# Theory
	•	List is a mutable, ordered collection in Python.
	•	Lists allow duplicate values.
	•	Elements are accessed using indexing (starting from 0).
	•	Negative indexing accesses elements from the end.
	•	Lists support dynamic resizing, meaning elements can be added or removed.
	•	Python provides many built-in methods to manipulate lists efficiently.

Common List Methods Used:
	•	append() → Adds an element at the end
	•	insert() → Inserts element at a specific position
	•	remove() → Removes specified element
	•	extend() → Combines two lists
	•	sorted() → Returns sorted list

⸻

# Application
	•	Storing and managing student records
	•	Handling marks, names, or items dynamically
	•	Data analysis and processing
	•	Implementing stacks, queues, and other data structures
	•	Useful in real-time applications like inventory systems, attendance systems, etc.

# Conclusion

This program successfully demonstrates the use of Python lists and their operations. Lists provide flexibility due to their mutable nature and built-in functions, making them suitable for handling real-world data efficiently. Understanding lists is essential for advanced programming concepts such as data processing, algorithms, and application development.
